# PowerScp

PowerScp is a PowerShell module based on assembly of popular software by by **Martin Prikryl** [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) which aims to implement all features available in WinSCP GUI in an easy to use PowerShell moduele.

## Project History

PowerScp was born out of necessity to create an automation framework to transfer files via SFTP, with WinSCP being the de-facto standard for SCP/SFTP transfers in the Windows world I used its, **wonderful**, assembly to implement same functions in the module.
