# PowerScp

PowerScp is a PowerShell module based on assembly of popular software by by **Martin Prikryl** [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) which aims to implement all features available in WinSCP GUI in an easy to use PowerShell module.

## Project History

PowerScp was born out of necessity to create an automation framework to transfer files via SFTP, with WinSCP being the de-facto standard for SCP/SFTP transfers in the Windows world I used its assembly to implement same functions in PowerShell.

When I initially I started working on the proiject my need was simply to have an easy way to transfer fiels to a remote SFTP Server but as I started working on this I saw the potential to implement additional features and *cmdlets* which lead to the creation of the module.
